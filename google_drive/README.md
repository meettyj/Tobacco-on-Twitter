# If you want to download file directly from Google Drive:

```
pip install gdown
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=
```

Please noticed here the ID we entered at the end is file ID. If you want to download some directory, a possible way to do is generating link for every file within the directory. Then write some script to download those files by the command above.
