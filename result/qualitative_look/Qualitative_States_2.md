@VapeWild @jmodzboxbuilds I just took a stab in the dark. When I bought my first Kangertech NEBOX it was $150 so I just went off that.

@VapeWild @jmodzboxbuilds Hmm...$110?

@JakeDeann @VapeWild @jmodzboxbuilds I bought my first one the day they officially came out so they were more expensive. I also got the 2nd one from eBay so it was much cheaper.

Hannah just requested a venmo from me for $2.00 w the caption "pls I'm out of vape juice."
