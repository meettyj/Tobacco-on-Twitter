@VapeWild @jmodzboxbuilds I just took a stab in the dark. When I bought my first Kangertech NEBOX it was $150 so I just went off that.

@VapeWild @jmodzboxbuilds Hmm...$110?

@JakeDeann @VapeWild @jmodzboxbuilds I bought my first one the day they officially came out so they were more expensive. I also got the 2nd one from eBay so it was much cheaper.

Hannah just requested a venmo from me for $2.00 w the caption "pls I'm out of vape juice."

Yeo who‚Äôs selling juuls for the lowski I lost mine lastnight and I‚Äôm not paying 60 bucks for another one

can someone venmo me 50 dollars i wanna buy a juul

They dont want to "over tax" it at one time as that would be cruel.  A buck a pack is Just a dollar a day, that doesn't  hurt much. They all say i will quit or cut back but that just doesn't seem to happen. Funny most of the Americans at conference just got a tax cut!

@PeterJGWard @SenBlumenthal You dont understand. Cigarettes are a 54 billion dollar tax scam on poor people.. e cigs are the enemy.
