Had those be true vapor maxs in my cart and PayPal wanna cat off 😭

@Eaze_Team I want to return my order it's before midnight and there are no more vaporizers - how do I do that?

Has anyone smoking a vape pen ever NOT looked like an asshole? The answer MAY surprise you! Jk, it's no. The answer is no.
