@lawlerb @weruvapets Oh no. I'm inclined to believe it could be any of their foods, regardless of what market. I plan to call them.

@TheGreyKing @onebrightlight @larochewastaken I have no context for this but I'm still getting the vapors rn

Are swisher wraps gonna be rapped to death?

Had those be true vapor maxs in my cart and PayPal wanna cat off 😭

@Eaze_Team I want to return my order it's before midnight and there are no more vaporizers - how do I do that?

Has anyone smoking a vape pen ever NOT looked like an asshole? The answer MAY surprise you! Jk, it's no. The answer is no.
