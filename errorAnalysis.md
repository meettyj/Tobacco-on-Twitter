Actually, for the place where most yellow and red occurs (LR model in current, looking and reflecting), I have successfully made the performance same as the initial one (second table), but still much lower than the paper statement (first table). I have no idea how Jason generate the result in paper. Using the model he leaved and retraining, only got the same performance as what I did in grid search. So weird.
