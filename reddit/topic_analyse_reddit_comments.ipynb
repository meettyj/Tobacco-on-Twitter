Right now, that lobby representation does not exist in CA, mostly due to the disbanding/abandonment of the SFATA chapters that once existed. I am deploying some effort in the direction of getting something going but the industry in CA is more fractured now than it ever was so getting that going is not as easy as it may sound.

I had spoke about how she wished e-cigs were around because they might still be alive.

      "Hello, my name is [REDACTED]. I was a smoker for approximately 25 years before I switched to vaping. I smoked a pack a day or more. Vaping has been the only method by which I was able to quit the deadly habit of smoking. I am now smoke-free for approximately 3 years. I feel better physically &amp; mentally since switching to vaping. Different flavor options in e-liquids were essential for me in the transition to vaping. Without all the amazing flavor options out there I don't know if I could have quit smoking. Limiting these options would be extremely detrimental to those who wish to improve their lives &amp; quit through vaping. I urge you as a former smoker &amp; registered voter to please reconsider your position on the pending flavor ban.

How fun!!! I was well aware that I was killing myself slowly. Spent my mornings hacking up my lungs to remove the tar of the previous days pack of smokes. At age 26, 2 friends of mine bought me my first vape pen. The first E liquid they provided me with was from Elixer Eliquid out of Katy TX. It was called \"Fuzzbuster\" and was a Caramel chocolate chip cookie flavor. It quickly became my favorite. I quit cigarettes almost immediately. Since then I have tried going back to a more traditional cigarette flavor, but it was  reminiscent of the tobacco cigarettes I was smoking before. After cherry chocolate pudding, strawberry cheesecake, pina colada and a multitude of other candy and desert flavors, the tobacco flavor just isn't good enough to stay with the safer alternative to smoking.\n",

      "I had been a pack-a-day or more smoker since I was 15 years old, and over 2 packs a day in my 30's and 40's. After countless failed attempts - both on my own and with professional assistance - the longest I had managed to go without a smoke was 5 days, and that was immediately after the death of my mother from lung cancer. I held her head as she died, and swore I'd never smoke again. When I broke in the face of that less than a week later and lit up another cigarette, I made my peace with smoking. It was my master, and I would never break free of its hold. I became resigned to the fact that I would die with a cigarette in my hand. About 10 years after that, I learned about electronic cigarettes. Back then, the only thing available was the 'cigalike' style, it looked like a cigarette, was the same size as a cigarette, but was considerably heavier due to the battery. I became a dual user, vaping on an electronic cigarette in places where I couldn't light up a real smoke. The vapor was weak and the flavor was unpalatable, but it gave me a brief respite from the constant nagging in my body for nicotine, so I used it to augment my habit - there was no danger of it becoming an actual replacement for a true smoke. I did that for a couple of years, until my setup began to fail. When my last battery died and wouldn't recharge, I started looking for something to replace it. At that time, the new thing was the eGo-T, a refillable tank-based electronic cigarette that looked more like a Sharpie pen than a Marlboro. Because it was refillable, I had to buy juice for it, which led me to a world of available flavors and varying strengths of nicotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time I filled up that eGo-T device was with 24mg juice that tasted like caramel. I put out the Camel Wide cigarette that I was smoking to give it a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never lit another cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of more power from the device and more nicotine and flavor from the juice 'rang my bell' in a way that no cigarette ever had - here was something that could not only act as a replacement for burning tobacco, it was actually preferable. It was the availability of that combination that gave me the strength to beat the unbeatable, to reclaim my life from an addiction I had long accepted as my new normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "That moment happened at 5pm on April 22, 2011, and I have never touched tobacco since... and have never even been tempted. I still vape, but at a drastically lower level (6mg), and it is not uncommon for me to go days without a vape. Back when I was a hardcore smoker, I couldn't go 30 minutes without a cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you take this option off the table, the ability to choose flavors that appeal to your personal tastes, you will be denying your constituents the tools they need to better and extend their lives. The science is there - vaping is orders of magnitude less harmful for the user and the people around them than smoking - and we have the very real possibility of eradicating the scourge of tobacco addiction in a very short time. Please don't stand in the way of that. Allow people the choice.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm writing to you today regarding the unintended negative health, safety, and economic impact of your proposed legislation banning flavorings from e-liquid. I am 41 years old. I was a pack-a-day smoker for 27 years.This translates into roughly 197,100 cigarettes in my lifetime. I tried cold turkey, patches, gum, and medications. Nothing worked except vaping. With the help of a caring friend and a local vape shop, I found a setup that satisfied my diminishing nicotine cravings in a way that has kept me from relapsing to tobacco products. That is at least 2,433 cigarettes I have not smoked. I hope that I live long enough to have NOT smoked 197,100 cigarettes. Vaping is the only thing that's helped me work towards achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of flavored e-liquid, my health has improved. I no longer wheeze from walking down the block, my eczema is healing, and my allergies are on the decline. Smoking for 27 years had damaged my taste buds extensively.The variety of flavored e-liquids has helped me rediscover my sense of taste. Often, they're flavored like a food restricted from your diet. I have lost 13 pounds satisfying my sweet tooth with a vape instead of a cookie. Flavored e-liquids are helping me enjoy my new-found taste receptors and keep me committed to staying off of tobacco. Caramel Cappuccino tastes nothing like a cigarette, but quenches the urge to smoke after a meal. With only the choice of something that tasted similar to, but without the satisfaction of cigarettes, I'd almost certainly relapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding safety, the vaping community is largely aware of the health risk of long-term exposure to chemicals like Diacetyl and Acetoin (Acetyl Propionyl).  E-liquid vendors have undertaken the financial burden of independently testing for these substances and publishing results for an informed community with high standards. While we don't yet have long-term studies on the health risks of inhaling flavors, smoking tobacco is definitely carcinogenic. Research shows vaping is not, referencing a long-term study of vapers and smokers, measuring their carcinogen levels over time versus a control group. I would rather take an unknown chance of a health risk from flavorings than the certain health complications of smoking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please consider the current and future economic impact of this ban on your community. It would put manufacturers and retailers out of business. Many successful manufacturers employ chemical engineers and gourmet chefs with specialized skills, and the ban would remove a large portion of retailers' recurring income from this merchandise.  Vaping may not a huge industry right now, but it's certainly heading that way as more people learn that it can actually help them finally quit tobacco products and eliminate nicotine intake. This ban will harm those of us who want to stay tobacco-free, as well as the manufacturers and retailers working to develop and maintain high quality standards.\n",

It was hard fighting the physical addiction but only after a week my nerves calmed and I no longer craved a cigarette. I never would have been able to quit if it had not been for the flavors. Combustion cigarettes taste terrible to me after having a huge variety of flavor, I have no urge to return to cigarettes.

If I see for example two bottles, one with a bowl of crunch berries and another with colorful skittles candy I'll know okay, these juices taste like cereal or candy. If they are all white labels with black lettering then you're going to have to ask the worker \"hey what's that, and that, oh I can't read that what's it say?\" There's just a fine line that companies need to find. \n",

Cake flavored vodka and alcoholic energy drinks like four loko which have flavors such as grape, blue raspberry, and watermelon and there in bright neon colored cans and I just think to myself wow that doesnt look like its tailored to kids at all so I bought 1 get in my car chug about half of it and got some wendys parked in the parking lot ate my burger and chugged the other half of the four loko then I back out and start driving and holy hell I had to stop on the side of a road and have a friend pick me up I was as drunk as if I had just took shots and ive seen kids 14 and 15 chug 2 or 3 of these things, it sickens me to know we live in a world where flavored alcoholic beverages  and flavored tobacco products are in the hands of children but god forbid I vape some key lime pie flavored e juice that its sold at stotes with signs saying 18+ and put on the top shelf in my house god forbid my vape doesnt taste like dog shit but sure why not have cake flavored vodka sold in every market and pharmacy where kids can easily reach and shop lift these items \n",

      "&gt; “Flavored Tobacco Product” means any Tobacco Product ... that contains a Constituent that imparts a Characterizing Flavor.\n",

A bottle of flavored e-juice with nothing but the word \"Nothing\" on it would still be banned.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the issue of labeling, all this ordinance says is that if a tobacco product's marketing/labeling implies it has some \"characterizing flavor,\" then it will be *presumed* to be a flavored product. For example, if a cigarillo package or a bottle of e-juice has the word \"blueberry\" on it, the presumption is that it contains a flavored tobacco product. This is also exactly what any consumer would expect and basically just discourages false advertising. (Btw, the fact that this is a \"rebuttable assumption\" means that the product will be presumed to contain flavoring unless proven not to. In other words, guilty of flavor until/unless proven innocent.) This language doesn't constitute a labeling requirement; I suspect it's just there to thwart anybody who might try to sell *unflavored* tobacco products (not banned under their definition) as flavored products. So if a sleazy vendor wanted to slap the word \"menthol\" on a pack of unflavored tobacco to make a quick buck before going out of business, this would throw a wrench into that plan.\n",
