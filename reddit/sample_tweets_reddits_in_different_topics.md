# 2. Empath
## 2.1 negative_emotion
### Proposal
- **ecig tweets**: It's hard to quit vaping when all your friends vape...üò©
- **reddit comments**: 
  - I like cars.   But they're dangerous.   Kill more people than guns.   Doesn't mean I stop liking cars.    And simply because I like cars, I don't think we should pretend automobile accidents aren't a leading cause of fatalities.   The most dangerous thing you do on a routine basis is drive.
  - What is dumb about it? Kids aren't allowed to even see these things in the store.
  - The reason to point out that the hypocrisy is to show that it *isn't* about the children. That is what they would have you believe, and have you fight that battle based on some sort of logical "for the kids!" stance. When its actually economic, and about entrenched powers that do not want to allow any give in the fight against "smoking".
  - We get abused, called douches and gay because we vape. 
  - Thanks! The whole point of fighting these local bans hard is to take the wind out of the sails of a state bill that would otherwise pop up early next year to "fix" the patchwork of local crap they created and then have to deal with a state wide ban to fight. Best to prevent that at all cost rather than risk a state battle we might lose... because it's CA.
  - If everything made for adults needs to be awful tasting in order to deter children from getting into them (which it doesn't I got drunk on straight Everclear the first time I ever had alcohol as a teen) then this would affect a lot more than cigarettes and vapor. 
  - Forces with billions of research dollars at their disposal and massive profit incentives have had 10 years to come up with evidence of any harm - so far they haven't.  Instead, they've had to resort to deception and shallow comparisons to tobacco smoking in order to restrict vaping.  That should tell you something.

### Approval
- **ecig tweets**: 
  - When was the first time you thought you lost your juul
  - @GRIMECRAFT that meant cigarettes too?!? for some reason i thought it just meant vape shit
  - emily just told me she‚Äôd stop being my friend if i get a juul ://
  - The FDA is trying to kill vaping because it‚Äôs going to do a better job reducing lung cancer than they ever have, an‚Ä¶
- **reddit comments**: 
  - And the foods themselves the flavors are mimicking. That's all bad for us and purposefully entices kids. Maybe it should all be banned, according to this idiot "logic."
  - And no mixed drinks at bars, which are just going to send drunk idiots to drive home anyway. :) 
  - "You take a couple of puffs and you actually feel like you're kind of high," said Richardson. The fuck is wrong with this guy?
  - The last thing you ever want to hear, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help". People are unbelievably stupid these days.
  
### Enforcement
- **ecig tweets**: 
  - I swear a vape pen at work saves lives...
  - If the city of San Francisco wants people to stop juuling so badly they should‚Äôve just banned all flavors except cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Big power move.
- **reddit comments**: 


## 2.2 business/money/economics/shopping
### Proposal
- **ecig tweets**: 
  - Name an industry that has multiple years of 70+% growth, made countless good jobs, and improved the health of millions. #vape #ecig #vaping
  - @coaxmetal They are single use vapes... These exist in the cannabis industry as well, but this is straight up selling people ghost vitamins.
- **reddit comments**: 
  - it really sucks that your co-worker may be going back to cigs : (
  - I believe this flavor ban was caused by the cutesy hype marketing and has nothing at all to even do with flavor.
  - All the people that say alcohol isn't marketed the same way hadn't stepped foot into a liquor store in the past decade. There is an entire isle filled with cutesy sweet liquors( chocolate liquor, birthday cake flavored rum and vodka, hell the whole shelf of mad dog 20/20 looks like liquid Skittles).
  - I've stated this since the beginning, it's not about the flavors, or the packaging, or the kids... It's about control.
  - "Oh no, it all looks like candy..." Well dang, but as sure as shit isn't candy. You know it, the people that buy and vape it know it, and anyone who spends any significant amount of time with those people probably know it as well.

### Approval
- **ecig tweets**: 
  - Bout to put my whole life on hold so I can work as a legal assistant at juul
  - @clusterfest what's the policy on vape pens?
  - @adambain If you‚Äôre stretching to include corporate incubation, Juul might be one of the most successful corporate‚Ä¶
  - @sfgov @sfchronicle you people are such lying hypocrites! Ban vape juice but allow kids to buy weed. Genius. Free h‚Ä¶
  - The FDA is trying to kill vaping because it‚Äôs going to do a better job reducing lung cancer than they ever have, an‚Ä¶
- **reddit comments**: 
  - If a 16 year old walks into a store trying to buy vape juice, number one the store needs to check ID, throw them out and tell them to fuck off. And if a teen somehow gets ahold of it, why is no one paddling their ass? Theyre old enough to know better.
  - The same bullshit politicians and agencies always pull when they need emotional reactions from the uninformed masses.. "THINK OF THE CHILDREN!"
  - They now need to ban all flavoured alcoholic drinks. 
  - Here is a clue...It has NOTHING to do with kids.
  - JFC. They ALREADY do this! Hence the need for a law preventing it.
  - other internet providers will jump in and offer service 
  - Yay "free" markets!
  - The majority of these ridiculous laws don't help. NY didn't become skinnier because they banned large sodas, it just became more regulated and bureaucratic.

  - You can buy recreational weed at any corner, but alternate smoking like vape...
  - Still looking for a job but, hey I am one month juul-free!
  - can i be a juul pod sommelier ?? is that a job yet ?

## 2.3 speaking/communication
### Proposal
- **ecig tweets**: 
  - The sound of someone vaping makes me want to vape moreüò©üòµ
  - Has anyone smoking a vape pen ever NOT looked like an asshole? The answer MAY surprise you! Jk, it's no. The answer is no.
- **reddit comments**: 
  - we should be united in voting Dems out of office who refuse to accept anything less than getting the fuck out of it.
  - This new legislation in San Francisco bans menthol cigarettes. How are those packaged for children?
  - You're expecting reason from the same people who can't even tell the difference between a bullet and a gun.
  - Every vape shop I have walked into requires ID. If I buy something and my kid gets his hands on it, that's 100% on me. It shouldn't matter what the packaging looks like.
   - It's not like there are ads for kids saying " hey kids, cotton candy e juice is great for sleepovers!" I don't even think I've ever even seen a tv ad for e juice

- **ecig tweets**: 
  - @radiogeyser I have so much to say about shit like that. America is conservative when it comes to cigarettes, so le‚Ä¶
  - i cant believe lorde wrote ‚Äúgreen light‚Äù abt charging ur juul
- **reddit comments**: 
  - Lets break this down: The goal of big tobacco is to regain control of the market. Okay - so what. It has nothing to do with helping anyone but themselves. Again, so the fuck what. Who cares? The goal of vaping is to get people off smoking. How many consumers care if there are 5 companies making products or 5000? As long as the product is good and its a healthier alternative.
  - It's total bullshit. RJ Reynold apparently spent 10 million fighting this (close to nothing for them)
  - Just learn to make juice it's not rocket science 
  - Ohhhhh okay, you guys want to talk about misleading advertisements, do you?

### Enforcement
- **ecig tweets**: 
  - The next question that needs answering - how harmful is smoking e cigarettes vs. not smoking at all? #juul
  - I swear a vape pen at work saves lives...
  - the fact that i cannot vape on this packed bus is homophobic and anti-latinx, and san francisco needs to address this
- **reddit comments**: 


## 2.4 positive_emotion
### Proposal
- **ecig tweets**: 
  - someone just vaped right in my face i love san francisco
  - Celebrate Independence Day all weekend in The Lounge where you have the freedom to vape, smoke, and consume cannabis however you like
- **reddit comments**: 
  - I wrote them. I hope I sent it out right. Took me about 5 minutes, everyone should do this but something tells me less than 100 do. I hope I am wrong. Keep us posted on how many people are responding, it will motivate regardless.
  - I'm willing to put $10 bucks that after a month you're going to feel differently. They might let smoking go in bars, and you apparently don't understand what "public places" means, but have a sneaking feeling vaping in, say, the park, will get you a lil bit of hassle.
  - The only hope you *possible* have (and it's damned slim) is to get nothing but local people together and pack the next council meeting.
  - I honestly just don't see the point of the flavor ban, I wonder if they think neighboring cities will follow suit.

### Approval

  - #SparkSF had an awesome demo today! I love the #vapexhale machine. It"s dependable and you can use all kinds of cool attachments!
  - don‚Äôt trust vape shops when you‚Äôre drunk
- **reddit comments**: 
  - Four Loko looks like an energy drink I'd love to have as a kid.
  - I'd love to see who's behind the push to ban these.  Follow the money.
  - I am a person who orders online, and has supplied to DIY for the rest of my life. This ban won't affect me personally, but it's totally a step in the wrong direction.
  - Even the canadian government came out and said vaping was better than smoking on may 23rd.
