Here are reddit comments with anti-goverment stance in three month (proposal, approval, enforcement).

## 1. Proposal
- [6ijdlp](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/6ijdlp/first_flavor_ban_in_the_usa/)
  - Welcome to San Francisco, where the apathy is real, and the Board Of Supervisors rules with an iron fist that would make Sauron fearful.
  - I've stated this since the beginning, it's not about the flavors, or the packaging, or the kids... It's about control.
  - The government should have no business regulating vaping, and we should be united in voting Dems out of office who refuse to accept anything less than getting the fuck out of it.
  
- [6iv0ks](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/6iv0ks/no_sf_flavor_ban_we_need_everyones_help/)
  - Doesn't help that California is such shit with these personal freedom vs 'protect the children' instances while being a bellwether state... will do what I can
  - Sweet hypocrisy coming from San Fran again... It really is an insufferable city.
  - They also gave us that son of a nitch Leland Yee. The super anti gun california senator that was buying fully automatic weapons (way fucking worse than what he was trying to ban from california) from Islamic Terrorists in the Philippines to sell to criminals in the states. Let that sink in for a minute. Funding Terrorism, selling automatic weapons that are NOT even close to legal to criminals, accepting bribes, racketeering. I don't trust anything about that city, or anything coming out of it.
  - California just get worse and worse, and the Bay Area gets worse and worse. Eventually it'll be full of yuppie nimby tech autists gentrifying the entire area. I can't even feel bad, you people choose to live in the shithole known as San Francisco and downplay the massive negatives of it and massively overstate the positives.

## 2. Approval
- [8oytiu](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/8oytiu/sf_votes_for_flavor_ban/)
  - Except it's only liberal states proposing these bans. Only one side to blame here.
  - If they can ban 64 oz soda's, they can ban anything. I've been saying for years, America is turning into a nanny state.
- [8qwh4j](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/8qwh4j/vapor_retailer_in_sf_would_have_happily_voted_for/)
  - The fuck is wrong with this guy?
  - The last thing you ever want to hear, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help". People are unbelievably stupid these days.
- [8rlqof](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/8rlqof/we_have_lost_san_francisco_the_flavor_ban_is_real/)
  - The clouds and tricks does give the government their ammunition.
  - It's also the voters who decide a lot of this and right now we look very obnoxious to them.
- [8uof7u](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/8uof7u/san_franciscos_flavor_ban/)
  - Fuck ridiculous nanny-state government nonsense like this.
- [8ozrej](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/8ozrej/california_san_francisco_bans_sales_of_flavored/)
  - It started about individual freedoms and then it just became join the idiot hivemind or die because you're obv a nazi
- [8p04se](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/8p04se/san_francisco_bans_sales_of_flavored_tobacco/)
  - You're still allowed to shoot heroin and shit on the street so it's still a pretty good place to live
  
  
## 3. Enforcement
- [aff9cy](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/aff9cy/new_house_bill_would_tax_vapes_like_cigarettes/)
  - Why, this kind Congressperson and her cohorts have removed the heavy burden of thinking from me and everyone around me.
- [ahlnat](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/ahlnat/another_threat_to_ban_vapes_by_the_fda/)
  - Gottlieb needs to shit or get off the pot. Not that I want vaping banned of course but I'm sick of the guy swinging his dick around. The government is there to take action...Not make idle threats and act like bullies. Either follow through on something or just stop!
- [ai9pt8](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/ai9pt8/fda_threatening_to_ban_vaping_altogether/)
  - You don't get it, that's what they want. Vaping has had a HUGE impact on cigarette sales, and thus on the TAXES collected. Because of the way these were divvied up in the Tobacco Settlement in the 90s, states are losing out big time. So the politicians make big noise about vaping, when in fact teen smoking numbers are at an historic low. They can then ban it "because of the children", and force people to become smokers again.
  - I’m tired of government agencies trying to take away our personal rights. This is the most ass backwards shit I’ve ever heard.
- [akzio7](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/akzio7/us_american_academy_of_pediatrics_calls_for_ban/)
  - Well it seems the AAP has been taken over by idiots, or shills. Hard to tell anymore who is genuinely stupid, and who is being paid to spread bullcrap.
