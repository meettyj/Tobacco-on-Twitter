  - Welcome to San Francisco, where the apathy is real, and the Board Of Supervisors rules with an iron fist that would make Sauron fearful.
  - I've stated this since the beginning, it's not about the flavors, or the packaging, or the kids... It's about control.
  - The government should have no business regulating vaping, and we should be united in voting Dems out of office who refuse to accept anything less than getting the fuck out of it.

  - Doesn't help that California is such shit with these personal freedom vs 'protect the children' instances while being a bellwether state... will do what I can
