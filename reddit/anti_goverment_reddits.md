  - Welcome to San Francisco, where the apathy is real, and the Board Of Supervisors rules with an iron fist that would make Sauron fearful.
  - I've stated this since the beginning, it's not about the flavors, or the packaging, or the kids... It's about control.
  - The government should have no business regulating vaping, and we should be united in voting Dems out of office who refuse to accept anything less than getting the fuck out of it.

  - Doesn't help that California is such shit with these personal freedom vs 'protect the children' instances while being a bellwether state... will do what I can
  - Sweet hypocrisy coming from San Fran again... It really is an insufferable city.
  - They also gave us that son of a nitch Leland Yee. The super anti gun california senator that was buying fully automatic weapons (way fucking worse than what he was trying to ban from california) from Islamic Terrorists in the Philippines to sell to criminals in the states. Let that sink in for a minute. Funding Terrorism, selling automatic weapons that are NOT even close to legal to criminals, accepting bribes, racketeering. I don't trust anything about that city, or anything coming out of it.
  - California just get worse and worse, and the Bay Area gets worse and worse. Eventually it'll be full of yuppie nimby tech autists gentrifying the entire area. I can't even feel bad, you people choose to live in the shithole known as San Francisco and downplay the massive negatives of it and massively overstate the positives.
