bb1ejn,Flying from Los Angeles (BURBANK) to San Francisco (SFO) with a weed vape pen. Can I fly with it? Will have the Cartridge separated from the pen.,"I'm Flying from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a weed vape pen. Can I fly with it? I will have the Cartridge (single cartridge) separated from the pen and in my carry on. Would it be risky since I am from California, over 21 and obviously both cities are in California so it's legal in the state and cities,  so I am not getting out of state/passing state to state. So Would this be an issue? Thanks!    Flying from Burbank(LA) to San Francisco with a weed vape pen.

bewjks,San Francisco will be moving full steam ahead with full-on prohibition on the sales of all vapor products,"San Francisco will be moving full steam ahead with full-on prohibition on the sales of all vapor products including the online sales and shipping to residents in the city. As supervisor Walton said tonight (and by the time I am done typing that should read ""last night"") to a vape shop owner, ""I'm thinking of my kids, I don't care about your business"". I wish more than one vapor specialty store owner would have shown up tonight so they could have sat across from what I can only describe as ""evil incarnate"". A man, so intent on taking away a safer alternative that he is best suited for a role as a villain in a bad Bond movie parody than to serve as a chosen representative of the unfortunate crowd that voted him in office. The reality is, two years ago everyone figured flavor bans would be contained in SF. And they weren't and look at where things are now. Something much worse is about to take place at a very rapid pace and that's not fear mongering, that's a reality as I am sure most would now (finally!) perhaps agree on.
