ag5nvq,Places that still sell Juul in San Francisco?,"Apologies if this has been posted before, I live in the Haight area and walked into a couple smoke shops the other day and they all said they no longer sell Juul. Has Juul stopped selling in storefronts entirely in SF? Anybody know of places that still sell them?

Having the liquor store up the street carry pods for the same price as online . . . I did not know how lucky I was.
