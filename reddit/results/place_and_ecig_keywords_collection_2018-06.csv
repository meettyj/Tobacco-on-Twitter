*****
&gt; The battle over the flavored tobacco ban has been an expensive one in the city, with tobacco company R.J. Reynolds contributing nearly $12 million against the measure and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg contributing more than $3 million in support of it, according to filings with the San Francisco Ethics commission.

&gt; Last year, San Francisco city supervisors approved an ordinance to ban the sales of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, vaping liquid and flavored cigars, which would have made it the first in nation to approve such a sweeping ban on flavored tobacco sales.

&gt; Other Bay Area communities including Oakland have since passed bans on the sale of flavored tobacco.

&gt; Public health advocates have backed such bans, saying that candy-flavored tobacco products entice kids and teenagers and addict a new generation.

&gt; &amp;quot;San Francisco&amp;#039;s youth are routinely bombarded with advertising for flavored tobacco and e-cigarettes every time they walk into a neighborhood convenience store. It&amp;#039;s clear that these products with candy themes and colorful packaging are geared towards teens,&amp;quot; the American Lung Association stated.

&gt; Patrick Reynolds, the executive director of Foundation for Smokefree America, said that R.J. Reynolds, the tobacco company that his grandfather started, had spent a lot of money fighting the ban because it&amp;#039;s concerned that if it passes in San Francisco, other cities will follow suit.

&gt; Canada banned the sale of menthol cigarettes last fall, and a similar measure for the European Union will take effect in 2020.

&gt; Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said that some cities, including Duluth and St. Paul in Minnesota, have instituted more circumscribed bans than San Francisco&amp;#039;s, but held off widening their reach when they saw the pushback from R. J. Reynolds.

&gt; &amp;quot;The resounding vote in San Francisco is going to lead a lot of cities to take a closer look.""

&gt; &amp;quot;But San Francisco certainly has the expertise and capacity to enforce them.""

&gt; Just this week, the San Mateo County, Calif., Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a ban that very much resembles San Francisco&amp;#039;s and one in small, rural Yolo County, Calif.Although R. J. Reynolds led the attack on the ban, other groups joined in.

&gt; Small business owners also fought back, saying that the ban would sharply reduce their profits.
