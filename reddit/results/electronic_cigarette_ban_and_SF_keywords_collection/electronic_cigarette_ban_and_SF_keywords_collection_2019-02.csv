aqoiba,Maine Bill LD551: An Act to Ban Liquid Nicotine Containers,"Maine State Sen. Mike Carpenter has proposed a small change to a 2016 rule requiring child-proof containers for nicotine liquids: 

&gt;**2. Prohibition.** Beginning January 1, ~~2016~~ 2020, a person may not sell furnish, give away or offer to sell, furnish or give away a nicotine liquid container ~~unless the container is child-resistant packaging~~.

The new rule appears to ban all things which contain nicotine liquid...

According to [The free Press](https://freepressonline.com/Content/Home/Homepage-Rotator/Article/Eye-on-Augusta-Liquid-Nicotine-Polystyrene-Bans-Water-Extraction-CBD-Muzzling-Teachers/78/720/63083)

&gt;The proposal would not ban e-cig cartridges that are pre-filled and sealed.

Grimm Green talks more about this bizarre piece of legislation in his latest 510 report here (starting at ~6 min mark):
