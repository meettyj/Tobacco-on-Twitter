ahgkhe,Proposed ND flavor ban,"Well folks.  It is a scary time to be a vapor in ND.  A senator has proposed a flavor ban in my state of North Dakota.  It looks to ban all flavors beyond tobacco and menthol.  This is to battle the ""epidemic"" of teen vaping in the state.  If this happens, it will close up all of the local shops and push many back to smoking and theres not much we can do to at this point.  I've made calls and sent emails and the shops are banding together to try and stop this.  

Looking for anybody out there to help us out here and voice opinions against this!

ai9pt8,FDA threatening to ban vaping altogether,"I write this after I just heard on the radio, then did a quick Google search for results.

Aopearantly the FDA is threatening to ban vaping if 2019 shows even more increase of ""encouraging"" youth to nicotine products.

Honestly, this entire ordeal altogether is damn ridiculous. I understand the problem, it's not good and it is indeed an epidemic. But what in the fuck do you think is going to happen to the 3.8million+ youth already addicted to nicotine?

YOU'RE CONVERTING THEM TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS. I've experienced this firsthand with my brother-in-law. He started juuling in highschool and hasn't been able to kick the habit since. He's tried to quit but ends up smoking a cigarette with me a few days in, because he doesn't want his girlfriend to know.

The problem is that the FDA doesn't understand that vaping saves lives, and in no way is targeted to minors! Don't get me wrong, I'm sure some dumbass along the lime decided he/she could capitalize on the youth, BUT THIS IS NOT THE MAJORTY.

And just because the youth are endangered, you're going to take away an alternative for lifetime smokers, who will end up going back to cigarettes.

YOU CANNOT CONTROL PEOPLE, IT'S UP TO PARENTS TO PROPERLY INFORM THEIR CHILDREN OF THE DANGERS.

You're not going to stop a fucking teenager from getting his hands on a juul, simple as that.

We've already seen what happened with the 18th amendment, but you know what they say; history tends to repeat itself.

TL;DR FDA threatening to ban vaping because of increasing youth vapers, need to get their thumb out of our ass.

aicytd,"Beverly Hills, after their flavor ban, now wants to ban ALL tobacco products"," 

Feb 5 at 2:30pm over at the Beverly Hills City Hall, a study session will be held to see whether the city will move forward with crafting an ordinance that will BAN THE SALE OF ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS in the city. This has been an ongoing conversation since 2013 and at the time the legality of doing so was highly questionable. Yet, it seems the city wants to ""take the lead"" and show ""leadership"" in tobacco control so they're at it again. Might want to let the folks there know what you think of such amazing display of prohibition on adult choice.

ajier3,NYC latest on the flavor ban bandwagon," 

An ordinance (File #: T2019-3592) is being introduced that would ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes/vaping products in New York City. CASAA has obtained the draft language of this ordinance and it's about as bad as we could have imagined. This is a TOTAL BAN ON FLAVORS other than tobacco.  


This ordinance is scheduled for an oversight hearing on

**Wednesday, January 30, 2019**

**1:00 PM** ([details](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=671361&amp;GUID=7E67C63D-E2F2-4329-8C60-1094AFE57148&amp;Options=&amp;Search=))

**Committee Room - City Hall**

&amp;#x200B;

People are asked to attend the meeting if possible. Or if you live in NYC, go to the link here and there's a place where you can automagically send a letter to your NYC council member.

ajjs96,An email from CASAA - NYC attempting to instate a full on flavor ban,"I know this has been discussed back in November of 2018, but now it seems the threat is lingering in the hands of lawmakers. I recieved an email today from CASAA (Consumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association) in regard to this matter, and it seems that on January 30th this will all be discussed at City Hall. This doesnt seem to affect the state as a whole, but if NYC gets hit with a ban, who knows what other cities would try to follow suit. Below im linking the website that was listed in the email (not sure how to link the whole email, but the link has the most info) where it can be found and I believe if you google CASAA they will probably have even more about this.

The meeting on this is also being held at 1pm that day to which im assuming is open to the public. If so, I think I might attend to share my story and opinion and if anyone else in the NYC area can attend it would help. I just wanted to share this as a NYC resident and as someone who constantly has worry that my saving grace in quitting cigs will be taken from me. Im glad I picked up DIYing juice recently but still, its concerning. I hope we can all, as a community, share this to get word across and even try to voice are opinions as best as we can so we can save what we love. Thanks for reading!
