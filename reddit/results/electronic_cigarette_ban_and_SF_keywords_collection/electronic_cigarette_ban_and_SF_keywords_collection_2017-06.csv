6fmuh0,San Leandro CA Flavor Ban pushed to September,"San Leandro outcome; had it been put to a vote tonight this flavor ban would've been dead. However several council members want to do more research on the issues and on vapor and send the ordinance back to the Rules Committee. Which means it'll come back for consideration in September. That's a decent victory since that gives us time to have more conversations on the subject with the city.

Thank you everyone for being there and see you all tonight in Oakland!

6fvkkp,SF Flavor Ban Hearing!,"VAPE ADVOCATES! If anyone has the time to blow up the emails and/or phones of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from now until next Wednesday, June 14th about why flavors are crucial to quitting smoking combustible cigarettes, it would be MUCH appreciated. There will be a hearing on the 14th to talk about the proposed flavor ban, and I'd like to see the Supervisors absolutely buried in testimonials from vapers! A phone call or an email a day for the next week from everyone, everywhere who vapes would be ideal! Remember, be polite and professional for best results. Thank you vapers!!

6imjdh,SF Flavor Ban: Stop deflecting Blame!,"The flavor ban in SF passes, in a meeting where the item was not presented on the agenda at least 72 hour prior, and as predicted there’s a lot of noise about it now on social media.
 
Why am I seeing so many vapers and business owners spending so much time posting comments about this when there was hardly any activity from them while calls to action and awareness about this ordinance was being raised? Why are they all singling out a single brand for their unsophisticated and careless branding and trying to pin the entire blame of the ban on them? Why were these other business owners not engaged earlier in the months leading up to the first hearing to get customers in the affected area into hearings or taking actions that have been made very simple for them to engage in? Instead, I see more engagement after the fact now with a lot of finger pointing and complaining. Much more so than any activity deployed in which y’all could have been of some help. That’s not helpful, that’s just noise.
 
And, before anyone even thinks about saying I am defending the brand being singled out and blamed for all this, hell no. To that brand, if your customers are so in love with your branding, why didn’t they show up in droves in hearings to let the board of supervisors know that they are adults and love these labels and that their consumer choice would be infringed upon? Was it so hard to spend some time reaching out to customers in affected Zip code areas or were you too busy trying to look good with stories about rebranding? That’s not helpful, that’s just noise.
 
You ALL are now engaging in a deflection of attention to the REAL problem and that happens to be the organizations that create and push for these ordinances. Not a single shitty brand. Not just because of packaging. Because those of us who really are in the trenches every day know very well, and as folks working in the TC field will tell you, even if everything had plain packaging they’d still be going after the flavors, regardless. Instead, what you ALL are doing with your online noise is detracting from that focus AND detracting from the efforts still going on regarding the OTHER five flavor bans that are still in play in the Bay Area. That’s not helpful, that’s just noise.
 
So what are you all going to do about this? Continue on blaming each other so the TC folks can laugh their asses off seeing how this industry and community shifts the blame from where it belongs to THEMSELVES? Or are you going to help engagement and increase awareness levels on the other five ordinances in play? It’s really your industry and your choice, but out of respect for those actually trying to fight these things without playing the blame game, could you please keep the noise down or otherwise focus on the real opponents? Thanks!

6iv0ks,NO SF FLAVOR BAN!!! We NEED everyone's help!!,"URGENT CALL TO ACTION!! All vapers, please take a minute to copy and paste the email addresses in the link below into an email to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and their staff members. We got word last night that there will be one more vote next week to finalize the flavor ban. While it is probably a done deal and the vote just a formality, we still may be able to get some amendments and concessions added to the ordinance. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE...PLEASE DO IT!! Write a quick letter about how flavors helped you quit deadly combustible cigarettes and stay quit. As always, be polite and respectful, but get your point across. WE NEED EVERYONE'S HELP!!! Flood them with testimonials and ask that they reconsider. Thank you!!

6ixsg4,I'm part of a silent group of Vapers who supports the Flavor Ban,"Downvote this all you want.

Just want you to know that there are many vapers who support the flavor ban.

There are two aspects to the flavor ban.

1. The sale of nicotine solutions containing flavoring compounds.

2. The marketing of nicotine solutions containing flavoring compounds.

You're all being told to say ""I quit with flavors"".

Well, good for you.

But in order to quit, did you need your ejuice to come packaged in a bright orange and red colored bottle labeled ""gummy bear""?

No you didn't. 

But you're being asked to send in your ""I quit with flavors"" signs, and your message is being used to justify shitty marketing tactics.

I hope this flavor ban teaches you a lesson not to be so fucking stupid.

If you really want to make a difference, you'll contact your representatives and educate them on the difference between ""banana"" and ""isoamyl acetate"". Let them know that you don't care about the marketing, you just want to have access to premixed nicotine ejuice containing the flavoring compounds.

Either way, I don't really care. I've been a DIY flavor mixer for my whole 7 years of vaping. I've probably tried only about 3 premixed e-liquids ever.

Either smarten up, or join us in DIY.

At Vapor in a Bottle, we support advocacy and strongly encourage you to send these representatives an email, explaining why you oppose the flavor ban. Maybe tell your story of how you quit smoking using flavors. Whatever you tell them, please do it professionally.

In order to encourage you to send an email to these people, Vapor in a Bottle is offering a free 30ml bottle of our house juice with a purchase of $20 or more from our shop.

Our email is admin@vaporinabottle.com

We will then reply to your email and send you a coupon code that will knock $8.99 off of your order so long as it contains one of our house juices and the subtotal is $28.99 or more, before this discount. It will take us a little bit of time to do this, so do allow us a few hours to respond.

We know this isn't a huge discount, but many of you already order from us pretty often, so it's just a little way for us to say ""Thank you"" for helping out when you place your next order with us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/6j9x4e/a_little_incentive_to_email_san_francisco_about/,VaporInABottle,44,electronic_cigarette,2017-06-24 19:11:28,13,/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/6j9x4e/a_little_incentive_to_email_san_francisco_about/,Advocacy
