be3vst,Sacramento Flavor Ban Passed,"Moments ago, the Sacramento City Council decided to ignore all the public input they have received over the month, decided to ignore better proposals than unadulterated prohibition, and voted in favor of the flavor ban, including menthol. No exemptions. No mitigation. No concern about small business. No concern about former smokers that vape. The city decided to welcome illicit market development. The city decided smokers should continue to smoke. The city decided against common sense. This is a prime example of bad policy cultivation. The suggested implementation date for the flavor ban, extended by 90 days, will be January 2020.

Councilmember Carr could not support this ordinance and strongly opposes prohibition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/be3vst/sacramento_flavor_ban_passed/,StefanDidak,300,electronic_cigarette,2019-04-17 04:59:17,246,/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/be3vst/sacramento_flavor_ban_passed/,NaN

bewjks,San Francisco will be moving full steam ahead with full-on prohibition on the sales of all vapor products,"San Francisco will be moving full steam ahead with full-on prohibition on the sales of all vapor products including the online sales and shipping to residents in the city. As supervisor Walton said tonight (and by the time I am done typing that should read ""last night"") to a vape shop owner, ""I'm thinking of my kids, I don't care about your business"". I wish more than one vapor specialty store owner would have shown up tonight so they could have sat across from what I can only describe as ""evil incarnate"". A man, so intent on taking away a safer alternative that he is best suited for a role as a villain in a bad Bond movie parody than to serve as a chosen representative of the unfortunate crowd that voted him in office. The reality is, two years ago everyone figured flavor bans would be contained in SF. And they weren't and look at where things are now. Something much worse is about to take place at a very rapid pace and that's not fear mongering, that's a reality as I am sure most would now (finally!) perhaps agree on.
