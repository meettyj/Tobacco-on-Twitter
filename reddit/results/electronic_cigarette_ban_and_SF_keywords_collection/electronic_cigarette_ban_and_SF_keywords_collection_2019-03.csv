b31j4v,Bloomberg Editorial Board and AHA Want Total Flavor Ban; Quicker PTMA Deadline; Nicotine Limits in E-Cigs; E-Cigs Regulated Same as Cigs...,"In other words, they want most e-cigs to be taken off the market, and the rest to be regulated to the point that they lose much of their appeal relative to actual cigarettes.

The Bloomberg Editorial is in response to the FDA's proposed guidelines on flavor sales/PMTA, and is essentially the same as the American Heart Association's response, which is linked in the editorial (click ""enjoy"")

&gt;...One problem is that mint, menthol and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes will go on being sold much as before — and underage vapers [enjoy](http://newsroom.heart.org/news/fda-restrictions-dont-go-far-enough-to-address-the-e-cigarette-epidemic) these flavors, too...
&gt;
&gt;...The sale of fruit and candy flavored products should simply be banned. And all remaining e-cigarettes should be regulated as tightly as combustible cigarettes are. The FDA should constrain their advertising, and require that their ingredients be listed on the package by quantity.
&gt;
&gt;In addition, the nicotine content of e-cigarettes should be limited — as it is in Europe. Nicotine is what hooks people on smoking, and new American vapes often provide a greater hit of the substance than ordinary cigarettes do. Gottlieb himself has championed lowering the nicotine content of combustible cigarettes to non-addictive levels. The nicotine in vapes is at least as big a problem [as the nicotine in combustibles]...
&gt;
&gt;https://www.bloombergquint.com/view/fda-vaping-proposal-doesn-t-go-far-enough 

From the the AHA version (via the ""enjoy"" link):

&gt;&gt;“In a major oversight, the FDA’s new policy does not apply to mint or menthol e-cigarettes, even though the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey shows that more than half of youth choose mint and menthol. AHA’s Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center has also conducted research that shows that menthol was the second most popular e-cigarette flavor among teen users.

b6f9nm,CA SB38 State Flavor Ban Update,"As anticipated, the Senate Health Committee decided to pass the flavor ban bill (SB38 by Senator Hill). Since the question always comes up and there are people not versed on the legislative process, this does not mean that the flavor ban actually got enacted. It just passed this committee and will be heading to the next one. Watch out for information on that when it becomes available because you will be asked to engage and participate in the process.

I'd like to thank everyone who attended today and took time out of their busy schedules to stand up against prohibition. Especially since this is an act of prohibition against a safer alternative to smoking that has helped millions of people kick the deadly habit. Your presence today was invaluable as it helps demonstrate opposition to this bill and its current intentions of denying adults access to flavored vapor products. It helps with further ongoing conversations with other elected officials and committee members.

If policy-makers were serious about curbing youth access they would look at solutions that actually address the problem such as advanced age verification systems, purchase limits, penalties, enforcement, and marketing restrictions. Prohibition is never the answer and on this particular issue that needs to be made clear.
