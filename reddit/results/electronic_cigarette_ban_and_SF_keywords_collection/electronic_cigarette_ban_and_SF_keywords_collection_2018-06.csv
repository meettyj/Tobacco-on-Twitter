8r0173,Let's talk about the flavor ban.(Rip San Fran),"I think a conversation needs to be had between those of us that have been in this game for a while. 

It seems like a cycle of proposed regulation, failed advocacy, hard hits through said regulation, and then a work around. 

In my opinion, I think that the ""flavor ban"" isn't necessarily a terrible idea in the fact that it will deter youth from vaping candy like flavors and such. 

I think for those of us that know what we're doing, will and should still be able to get flavor shots for mixing into our ""flavorless"" liquid. But it should be harder than just buying a visa gift card from the gas station, forging a birth date on a website and ordering them in the mail.

That said, I love my flavors and don't want them to go away. But I see the mission.

8u400a,massachusetts State level Flavor ban,"Amendment S2571-1 has been introduced in the MA Senate with the goal of including vapor products and only offering an exemption for what MA calls ""Smoking Bars"" which are age restricted lounges and tobacco stores which require a separate permit for it (and at this time there's no telling whether vapor retailers will be able to obtain any).

If you're in MA it's time to make your voice heard and contact the legislators listed below. Explain to them the importance that flavored vapor plays in your smoke-free life and how this product category should be available and accessible everywhere from gas stations to c-stores and 711's and not just a few potential retailers that may be lucky to afford or obtain a permit.
