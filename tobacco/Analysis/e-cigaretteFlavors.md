[Four hundred and sixty brands of e-cigarettes and counting: implications for product regulation](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/23/suppl_3/iii3):

Generally, each flavour was coded into one of eight categories, including Tobacco, Menthol, Tobacco-Menthol, Fruit, Dessert/Candy, Alcohol/Drinks, Snacks/Meals and Others. 

By January 2014 there were 466 brands (each with its own website) and 7764 unique flavours. In the 17 months between the searches, there was a net increase of 10.5 brands and 242 new flavours per month.

# Preference for flavor

There are 13 papers described adolescents’ preference for flavor and 11 papers studied young adults’ preference for flavor, which can be find in paper [A systematic review of consumer preference for e-cigarette attributes: Flavor, nicotine strength, and type](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5854347/)

In general, young adults overall preferred sweet, menthol, and cherry flavors, while non-smokers in particular preferred coffee and menthol flavors. For adults in United States, a study found that the descending order was fruit, menthol/mint, and candy/chocolate/other sweet flavors. Besides, adults preferred flavors that elicit sweetness or coolness while flavors that elicit bitterness or harshness (most likely coming from nicotine) were less preferred.
