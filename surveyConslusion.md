# 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 
**Table Name:** [codebook including questions like how many Days in past 30 do you had alcoholic beverage
](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2017/pdf/codebook17_llcp-v2-508.pdf)

Page: 47.

**Conclusion:** The codebook seems useless. The result is not specific and hard to use. May only give a view how this survey is look like.
However, [another website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/index.html) provide some insight about the prevalence & trend in different location. 
Maybe we can incorporate the location information to do some work. 
Class are set to different state under topic of alcohol consumption, binge drinking, chronic drinking and heavy drinking.
