## Detail
In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 56, which amended the definition of "tobacco products," under the California Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law (Revenue and Taxation Code ยง 30121) for tax purposes. In addition to the traditional tobacco products (such as cigars, smoking, chewing, or pipe tobacco, or snuff) that are **subject to the tobacco products tax**, the distribution of the following new tobacco products are subject to the tobacco products tax beginning April 1, 2017:

- Little cigars (a cigarette tax stamp will no longer be required to be affixed to the package).
- Any product containing, made of, or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption (previously products, other than cigars, smoking or chewing tobacco, or snuff, had to contain at least 50 percent tobacco to be subject to the tobacco products tax).
- Any product containing, made of, or derived from nicotine that is intended for human consumption and sold with or without a nicotine delivery device.
- **Electronic cigarettes or any device or delivery system sold in combination with nicotine (examples of a device or delivery system include, but are not limited to, eCigars, ePipes, vape pens, and eHookahs).**
- Any component, part, or accessory of an electronic cigarette that is used during the operation of the device when sold in combination with nicotine (for example, a battery used in the operation of the device sold in combination with nicotine).

The following products are not subject to the tobacco products tax; however, they are still subject to cigarette and tobacco products retail licensing:

- **Vape liquids, such as eLiquid or eJuice, that do not contain nicotine or tobacco.**
- Any delivery device or system not sold in combination with any liquid or substance containing nicotine.
- Any battery, battery charger, carrying case, or any other accessory not sold in combination with nicotine.
