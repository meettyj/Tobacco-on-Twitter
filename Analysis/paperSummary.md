# [Causal discovery in social media using quasi-experimental designs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1964859)

## Matched Design
Identify pairs of units where one has received a treatment and the other has not but who are otherwise similar.

  - Does drinking alcohol cause people to be more offensive? (e.g. more dirty word)

  - the different possible dissease that may happened in male and female. (e.g. breast cancer & fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in female) 

## The Natural Experiment Design
Based on the change of social media itself. I guess we need to check the updating history of Twitter.

- [More clarity on reported Tweets and enforcement (October 2018)](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2018/more-clarity-on-reported-tweets-and-enforcement.html)
    
  Question: When people know their tweet violates the rule, are they tends to retweet it or leave it?
  
  Treatment: They know (T = 1). They don't know (T = 0).
  
  Outcome: The frequency of posting within N days. 

  ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?freq\=\\frac{\\sum_{i\=0}^{N}num_i(posting)}{N},N\\in\\{1,3,5,10,15,20,25,30\\})


  Does this policy encourage people to post more or post less?

## The Interrupted Time-Series Design
Some interruption occurs, based on time to evaluate the casual relationship.
