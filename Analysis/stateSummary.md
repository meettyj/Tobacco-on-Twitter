We can do experiments on all states that has tax since 2017, which is California (4/1/2017), Kansas (7/1/2017) Delaware (1/1/2018) and New Jersey (9/29/2018). 

For states that has tax since 2016, for example, West Virginia (7/1/2016) and Pennsylvania (7/13/2016), since the data from January to March in 2016 is not complete, we don't have enough data to run experiments on these two states.
